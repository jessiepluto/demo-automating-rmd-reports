## Creating Tabs 
  
The addition of `{.tabset}` tells markdown to apply the predefined tabset class to downstream sub-headers. In this example we start with a blank level one header (`#`) above. The following level two headers (`##`) are then interpreted as tabs. 
  
````{verbatim, lang = "md"}
# {.tabset}

Because the output of this R Markdown document is an `.html` file, css (and html) can be used to customize any part of the report. For example, I've added some css to customize the appearance of the tabs in this example. The stylesheet is saved as `styles.css` in the `extras/` folder of this project and applied very simply in the options.
